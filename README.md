I'm currently pursuing my PhD in Statistics at the 
[Hamilton Institute](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/hamilton), in
Maynooth, Ireland, and the focus of my research is Bayesian Machine 
Learning. This repository contains a wide diversity of links that I've 
found in any way useful for my current studies.

## Diversity Scholarships
  - Why do they exist?
    - To increase diversity & inclusion in the tech environment
  - What does it include, generally?
    - It can be either partial or full scholarships, including registration, accomodation, food and travel costs. It all depends on each conference/summer school rules. 
  - What to write in the application?
    - Your profile (where are you from, gender, what do you do now and plans to do later)
    - What is your current study/employment situation, emphasizing on how much going to the conference would be benefitial for it 
    - Explain your budget limitations clearly (e.g. PhD students have almost no money for conferences/programming resources)
    - Explain how do you plan to "give" back what will be learned in the conference/summer school (e.g. share content on GitHub, apply it in your thesis or specific project)
